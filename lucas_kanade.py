    encodes the per-pixel optical flow parameters in the x-axis and the

    Note that this method needs to support the case where u and v shapes do

    (1) cv2.resize to resize the u and v to the shape of the image.
    (2) Then, normalize the shift values according to a factor. This factor
    is the ratio between the image dimension and the shift matrix (u or v)
    dimension (the factor for u should take into account the number of columns
    in u and the factor for v should take into account the number of rows in v).

    As for the warping, use `scipy.interpolate`'s `griddata` method. Define the
    grid-points using a flattened version of the `meshgrid` of 0:w-1 and 0:h-1.
    The values here are simply image.flattened().
    The points you wish to interpolate are, again, a flattened version of the
    `meshgrid` matrices - don't forget to add them v and u.
    Use `np.nan` as `griddata`'s fill_value.
